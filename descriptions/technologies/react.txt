I started to learn React.js myself because it seemed very interesting to me, and I wasn't disappointed.
The functionalities it offers make writing web-apps a lot easier than in vanilla JavaScript because
of the integrated HTML-syntax in JSX. This portfolio is currently my only project using React, but I'm
intending for more to come.
