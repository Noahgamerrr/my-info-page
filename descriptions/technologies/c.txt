This is the language my programming journey started with. I learned the basics in my first year at the
HTL Villach and started building my own projects with it (even though pretty late) to strengthen my skills. 
My main projects are the implementation of a Java-like map using void pointers, as well as Wordle,
which also uses my map. I had a lot of fun writing those projects, especially because I learned a lot
about how a computer processes variables and pointers, theory that seems quite essential to understand
the technology we use. It is in my opinion the best programming language to start with, because it is
syntactically similar to other programming language and because you learn a lot about the architecture
of a computer.
