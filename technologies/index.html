I learned the basics in my first year at the HTL Villach and started building my own projects with it (even though pretty late) to strengthen my skills. My main projects are the implementation of a Java-like map using void pointers, as well as Wordle, which also uses my map. I had a lot of fun writing those projects, especially because I learned a lot about how a computer processes variables and pointers, theory that seems quite essential to understand the technology we use. It is in my opinion the best programming language to start with, because it is syntactically similar to other programming language and because you learn a lot about the architecture of a computer.</p></div><div class="technology-grid-1"><h2 class="technology-title-1 text-lg-center">Java</h2><img alt="Java" src="./images/technologies/java.png" class="technology-image-1"><p class="technology-description-1" style="text-align:justify">After the first year, we began to learn Java at school. That's when I started to write my first games and I started to really like the language. These projects include e.g. Pong, Snake and Space Invaders which I wrote using JFrame. These projects showed me the benefits of the object-oriented programming paradigm, which initially seemed rather tiring because of its verbosity. It was a different approach to what I was previously used to and an easier one. Worries about segmentation faults or memory leaks were gone, so that I could concentrate on finding better algorithms faster.</p></div><div class="technology-grid-2"><h2 class="technology-title-2 text-lg-center">JavaScript</h2><img alt="JavaScript" src="./images/technologies/js.png" class="technology-image-2"><p class="technology-description-2" style="text-align:justify">For web-application, we started to learn JavaScript at year two. While I didn't write projects up until a year ago, I quickly gained interest as soon as I learned about frameworks like React.js or Angular. Creating DOM-elements in vanilla JavaScript is of course tedious, but luckily JSX facilitates this process a lot so that writing code is more enjoyable. Other than that, I really like the syntax of JavaScript, as it makes it easier to write code which in other languages would have needed more lines of code. My projects include a definition-grabber from the web and a group project on JavaScript itself.</p></div><div class="technology-grid-1"><h2 class="technology-title-1 text-lg-center">HTML/CSS</h2><img alt="HTML/CSS" src="./images/technologies/html-css.png" class="technology-image-1"><p class="technology-description-1" style="text-align:justify">My main project using HTML/CSS is a website with German lessons I created for a Discord-Server. The biggest difficulty was to have a nice-looking page while also keeping the responsiveness in mind, but also the navbar which I didn't want to hardcode on every-single page was starting to bug me.</p></div><div class="technology-grid-2"><h2 class="technology-title-2 text-lg-center">Python</h2><img alt="Python" src="./images/technologies/python.png" class="technology-image-2"><p class="technology-description-2" style="text-align:justify">I started learning Python pretty early in my programming journey, but until recently I never really had any use for it as I became more interested in Java (for school reasons). This year, I started writing my own Chess-implementation in Python and I really enjoyed it, because Python has many features that would be impossible (and also feel illegal) in Java (e.g. calling non-static functions statically).</p></div><div class="technology-grid-1"><h2 class="technology-title-1 text-lg-center">Oracle SQL</h2><img alt="Oracle SQL" src="./images/technologies/sql.png" class="technology-image-1"><p class="technology-description-1" style="text-align:justify">I started learning SQL as part of a 6-week internship at Infineon Technologies in summer 2022. Of course, I only learned to write queries and could not write my own tables, but I quickly learned the missing information at school, so that my knowledge of this language is more complete. By the end of June 2023, I will have also aqcuired PL/SQL to further complete my skills.</p></div><div class="technology-grid-2"><h2 class="technology-title-2 text-lg-center">React.js</h2><img alt="React.js" src="./images/technologies/react.png" class="technology-image-2"><p class="technology-description-2" style="text-align:justify">I started to learn React.js myself because it seemed very interesting to me, and I wasn't disappointed. The functionalities it offers make writing web-apps a lot easier than in vanilla JavaScript because of the integrated HTML-syntax in JSX. This portfolio is currently my only project using React, but I'm intending for more to come.</p></div></main></div></div><div class="bg-dark footer mt-5"><a class="d-lg-none" href="https://github.com/Noahgamerrr" style="width:2.5rem"><img alt="github" src="./images/github.svg" class="github-img"></a></div></div></div></body></html>
