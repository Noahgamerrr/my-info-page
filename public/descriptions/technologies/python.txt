I started learning Python pretty early in my programming journey, but until recently I never really had
any use for it as I became more interested in Java (for school reasons). This year, I started writing
my own Chess-implementation in Python and I really enjoyed it, because Python has many features that would
be impossible (and also feel illegal) in Java (e.g. calling non-static functions statically).
